The Pacific Crest Trail covers more than 2,500 miles between Mexico and Canada and can take hikers 6 months to complete. (source: www.fs.usda.gov/pct) Would you like to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, but your busy schedule and faulty knees just can't handle it? With Trekkr, you can live vicariously through Instagram-wielding hikers. Instead of the months of preparation and months of hiking, trek the trail over your lunch break!

Trekkr is a gSchool individual project built with Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, the Instagram API, and MapBox/Leaflet web-mapping services.
